# Angular-Authentication

I have developed MEAN(MongoDB, Express Server, Angular, NODE JS) STACK Project where Registered user can only see the members page and other user can only see the home page.
•	Used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to design the pages.
•	Used postman to test user login/registration.
•	Used Angular component, services, and Routing.
•	JSON web Token, Route Guard, Token Interceptor for Authentication.
•	Implemented logout functionality
